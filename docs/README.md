## Building Kunani End-to-End

**[BUILDING_KUNANI_END_TO_END.md](./BUILDING_KUNANI_END_TO_END.md)** – Chaptered guide for building Kunani from scratch, aligned with the **Agentic AI e2e** YouTube series.

Use it to:

- Follow along during the tutorial.
- Understand repo structure (frontend + backend, same as Trivia Pals).
- See how each part fits: LLM service, Pydantic models, DB, LangGraph, agents, FastAPI, Next.js/shadcn.

Chapters cover: setup, `llm.py`, data models, database, tools, graph design, agents, memory/checkpointing, FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, end-to-end flow, and deployment.
